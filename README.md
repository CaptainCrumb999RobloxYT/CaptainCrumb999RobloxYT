- 👋 Hi, I’m @CaptainCrumb999RobloxYT
- 👀 I’m interested in making emulators and doing lots of homebrew.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unity, but I am intrested in, well, just read above.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a lot of people, most specifically, people who have:
      - Made an Emulator
      - Have experince with coding
      - Have experince of ROM Hacks and Homebrew.
- ❓ The reason I am doing this is because I don't have XP with emulating, I also don't have XP for Homebrew.
